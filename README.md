### Introduction
Diabetes remains a pervasive and important health concern within contemporary healthcare and medical research. Individuals with diabetes encounter challenges either in insulin production or the efficient utilization of insulin for glucose processing, resulting in potential complications such as cardiovascular issues and nerve damage. The multifaceted nature of this condition emphasizes the significance of research efforts aimed at explaining predictive factors for diabetes onset. Notably, existing medical literature has established correlations between diabetes and various risk factors, including obesity, age, and other demographic variables.

This project aims to address a pivotal question in the realm of diabetes research: **Can the onset of diabetes be predicted based on an analysis of a patient's medical history and demographic data?** To explore this question, we turn our attention to the [diabetes prediction dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iammustafatz/diabetes-prediction-dataset/code) meticulously curated by Mohammed Mustafa. Drawing from a global pool of medical and demographic data, this dataset contains a diverse array of features, including but not limited to age, body mass index (BMI), heart disease status, HbA1c level, and blood glucose level.

In the pursuit of answering our research question, we draw inspiration from relevant studies, such as the work by Brown et al. (2015), which explores predictive modeling in the context of diabetes, and the research by Diabetes Care (2005), delving into the prediction of diabetes development in older populations. These references serve as foundational pillars, guiding our approach and establishing connections between our project and established research in the field.

This project serves as an introduction to machine learning using python.
